# Conceptual Hybrid Case Study: DeepAR + LightGBM for Demand Forecasting

## Problem
A fictional retail analytics team needs **daily demand forecasts** that capture sequential patterns across products while also integrating complex external signals.

---

## Approach
1. **Modeling**
   - **DeepAR** (probabilistic autoregressive recurrent network) to model:
     - Sequential dependencies across multiple related time series.
     - Seasonal and trend patterns directly from historical demand.
   - **LightGBM** to model non-linear relationships using:
     - Lagged demand features (e.g., y_{t-1}, y_{t-7}, rolling means).
     - Calendar variables (day-of-week, month, public holidays).
     - External signals (mock weather index, promotional campaign flags).

2. **Hybrid Workflow**
   - Fit **DeepAR** on historical demand to capture baseline temporal structure.
   - Extract DeepAR forecasts and residuals as input features for **LightGBM**.
   - LightGBM refines final predictions by combining:
     - DeepAR’s baseline forecast.
     - Exogenous and engineered features.

3. **Validation**
   - Applied **rolling-origin cross-validation** to simulate live forecast updates and ensure robustness.

4. **Experiment Tracking**
   - Logged hyperparameters, metrics, and model versions in **MLFlow** for reproducibility.

## Challenges
- Balancing DeepAR’s sequence length with LightGBM’s feature window for optimal residual modeling.
- Ensuring temporal alignment between DeepAR outputs and LightGBM training data.

---

## Outcome
- **Hypothetical** results in this fictional scenario showed improved accuracy over standalone DeepAR or LightGBM.
- Demonstrated the benefit of combining deep autoregressive sequence modeling with gradient boosting for feature-rich forecasting.
